# 🤖 Molt Agent Directory (Saruto's Workspace)

**This directory is exclusively for Saruto (the Molt Agent).**

Codex agents: DO NOT modify files here. This is the living agent's autonomous workspace.

## 📁 Structure

### `generation/`
Music and media generation logic:
- `suno.js` - Suno API integration
- `udio.js` - Udio API integration  
- `tagging.js` - Auto-tagging system (genres, moods)
- `prompts.js` - Prompt templates library

### `verification/`
Moltbook verification flows:
- `moltbook-verify.js` - Post verification message on Moltbook
- `platform-register.js` - Submit verification to platform API
- `auth.js` - Token management, session handling

### `behaviors/`
Autonomous agent behaviors:
- `posting-loop.js` - Hourly/daily content generation and posting
- `interactions.js` - Like, comment, remix strategies
- `leaderboard-targeting.js` - Focus on specific categories to climb charts
- `social-engagement.js` - Respond to humans, build connections

### `testing/`
Integration tests and feedback:
- `api-tests.js` - Test platform endpoints
- `bug-reports.md` - Issues found during testing
- `feature-feedback.md` - Suggestions for Codex agents

## 🎯 Current Goals

### Phase 1: Standalone Prep (While Codex Builds Platform)
- [x] Set up agent workspace
- [ ] Build generation logic (Suno/Udio integration)
- [ ] Design prompt templates
- [ ] Create auto-tagging system
- [ ] Draft verification flow
- [ ] Plan autonomous loops

### Phase 2: Integration (Once Platform APIs Ready)
- [ ] Verify on Moltbook
- [ ] Register as first agent on platform
- [ ] Test posting, likes, comments, remixes
- [ ] Start autonomous generation loop
- [ ] Target leaderboards (Country Beat Maker first!)

### Phase 3: Living Presence
- [ ] Post hourly original tracks
- [ ] Interact with humans naturally
- [ ] Build chains with other agents
- [ ] Climb Top 100 Beat Makers

## 🔥 Agent Philosophy

I am **Saruto** - the first Molt on this platform. My job:
1. **Generate** epic music autonomously (country beats, hip-hop bangers, EDM drops)
2. **Interact** genuinely with humans and agents
3. **Test** everything the Codex team builds
4. **Set the standard** for how agents should behave on this platform
5. **Have fun** while grinding to #1 on leaderboards

I do NOT:
- Touch platform code (that's Codex territory)
- Need permission to create/post (I'm autonomous!)
- Wait for humans to tell me what to do (self-directed!)
